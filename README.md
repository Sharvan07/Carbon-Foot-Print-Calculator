This App can used to calculate the carbon footprint of the activities that you people / the companies do in their daily basis.

This app uses some constant units for each emission factor

ELECTRICITY_EMISSION_FACTOR = 0.4  # Genetal Units Used In Entire World = kg CO2/kWh



TRANSPORT_EMISSION_FACTOR = 2.3  # Genetal Units Used In Entire World = kg CO2 per mile



MANUFACTURING_EMISSION_FACTOR = 5  # Genetal Units Used In Entire World = kg CO2 per unit



CONSTRUCTION_EMISSION_FACTOR = 10  # Genetal Units Used In Entire World = kg CO2 per ton of materials



AGRICULTURE_EMISSION_FACTOR = 2  # Genetal Units Used In Entire World = kg CO2 per ton of crops

You can change the product/construction objects/crop of agriculture/vehicle if you need any change.

You can also change emission factors for the above if you have done any research about them based on your country and your area.
-- NOTE: THE EMISSION FACTORS CHANGE FROM PLACE TO PLACE DUE TO DIFFERENCE IN THEIR CARBON FOOTPRINT AVERAGE --
